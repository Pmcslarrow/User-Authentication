# Project Description

The old file contains some of my first ever frontend and backend code using NodeJS and Vanilla JS.

The new file is an updated version of a completely different project that exists in the same file directory. The new file project is a way to learn the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React, NodeJS)
through a User Management system that updates and deletes users
