# User-Authentication
Simply a project that I wanted to work on to learn more about Node JS and Express JS to work with the back end user authentication system to access a website I will make

I was able to connect the project to the Firebase database. Sadly, I can't add node_modules here because the file is too large. I hope to figure that out tomorrow with some compressing or binary files...
Currently, I was just working with the back end of it.... There are a few more things that I need to look at before I think it's ready,
but once I feel it is ready to go, I will then make it look prettier with CSS
